      <p>Each day, thousands of students walk past Lake Osceola on their way to class, yet few take the time to appreciate the diversity and rich history of this campus landmark.</p>

Once the university was built, the area was dredged out to become the lake we know today. <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2015/02/01/lake-osceola-a-changing-complex-landmark/">Read More</a></p>
